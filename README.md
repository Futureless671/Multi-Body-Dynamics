# Welcome to Orbital!
This software aims to be a physically accurate 2D simulation space for orbits and multi-body dynamics with simple visuals and a simple user interface. This is meant primarily as a visualizer for educational purposes and thus will be prioritizing simplicity and accessibility over feature complexity or simulation depth.
## Pre-release Disclaimer
Orbital is in the very early stages of development and will hopefully become more sophisticated and simpler to use as time goes on. At the moment, things are a bit of a mess, but the base features I wanted are working well enough for a pre-release. If in using Orbital you come across a bug or think of a suggestion for a 
future feature, please feel free to open an issue! All I ask is that you check through existing issues to make sure what you're reporting/suggesting doesn't already exist there.
## Roadmap
Here is a rough roadmap of where I plan to go with this software. The features and milestones listed below are in no particular order.
- [ ] Bug fixing... So much bug fixing
- [ ] Editor Orbit Previews
- [ ] Better and Smarter Scaling Options
- [ ] Spheres of Influence
- [ ] Saves
- [ ] Patched Conics
- [ ] Orbital Maneuvers/Î”V Calculations
- [ ] Body Information Popups
- [ ] Camera Controls/Camera Follow
- [ ] Trail Customization
- [ ] Platform Porting
